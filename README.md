## 🎯 Overview

This project is a conceptual redesign of the **YouTube mobile interface** to combat **compulsive binge-watching** by Generation Z. Instead of using intrusive limits, the interface promotes **mindful breaks**, **positive affirmations**, and a **gentler visual flow** to softly nudge users into healthier digital habits—**without sacrificing retention**.

## 🌸 Key Features Shown in the UI

### 1. 🎥 Relaxing Content Tile
- **Content Theme**: Calm and mindful categories like _Relaxing Nature Sounds_, _Meditation_, _Stress Relief_.
- **Pastel aesthetic** and **rounded cards** enhance the feeling of safety and calmness.

### 2. 🧘‍♀️ Mindful Break Prompt
- A **softly styled card** appears between videos suggesting:  
  _“Consider taking a break”_  
- Offers **two options**:
  - ✅ **OK** – Acknowledge and proceed
  - 🌬️ **Breathe** – Triggers a 5-second calming bubble animation or breathing exercise (Lottie-style animation)

### 3. 🌙 Focus Mode Toggle
- A clean **switch** within the mindful prompt, allowing users to enter a **low-stimulation mode**.  
  When active, the feed dims, autoplay pauses, and animations reduce.

### 4. 💬 Positive Messaging UI
- Stickers like **“Don’t Forget to Smile”** and **“See the Good”** are woven into content previews to subtly reinforce positivity.

### 5. 📱 Clean Navigation Bar
- Home, Create, and Notifications icons are placed at the bottom with **rounded edges** and **minimal distractions**, enhancing the feel of clarity and digital peace.
